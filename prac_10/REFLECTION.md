# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My estimate accuracy typically starts lower during the initial stages of development but improves significantly as the process progresses. Initially, estimates might be less precise due to unoptimized code or incomplete data processing. However, through debugging, optimization, and iterative testing, the accuracy improves.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
Early estimates may be less accurate due to unoptimized code or logic errors.Fixing bugs and refining logic helps improve initial accuracy.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
Initial estimates are often rough, and it’s through iterative refinement—debugging, optimizing, and testing—that accuracy improves. Each iteration brings better understanding and refinement. The quality of input data has a significant impact on estimate accuracy. Clean, well-preprocessed data leads to more accurate and reliable estimates.
## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
Different reviewers bring unique insights, which often highlight aspects I may have overlooked. This diversity of thought leads to a more comprehensive understanding and better outcomes.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
 Reviewing others' code exposes me to different ways of solving problems, broadening my perspective and helping me learn new techniques or approaches that I might not have considered.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
Design tasks that closely mimic real-world scenarios, making the exercises more practical and relevant to the students’ future careers. This could involve industry-specific projects or problem-solving based on current trends.Incorporate case studies that require applying theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, helping students see the practical implications of what they are learning.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
 I consistently applied strong analytical thinking to break down complex problems into manageable parts, ensuring that each step was carefully considered and logically sound.
Creative Solutions: I often found innovative ways to tackle challenges, exploring multiple approaches before selecting the most effective solution. I paid close attention to details, ensuring that my work was accurate, well-documented, and free of errors. This was particularly important in coding and data analysis tasks, where precision is critical.
Quality Control: I routinely checked and rechecked my work, which helped minimize mistakes and improved the overall quality of the deliverables.
